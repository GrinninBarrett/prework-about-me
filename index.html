      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a music teacher, and while I love music and may even love teaching some days, I'm excited about expanding my programming 
          knowledge and potentially changing careers.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Abingdon, VA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Before injuries, I used to run a lot. Maybe I can get back into ultramarathons again someday, but for now, I enjoy building
          custom mechanical keyboards, playing video games, and cooking.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think my dream job is to be a web/software developer in a remote position. I would hope to have luck finding a job with a company
          that serves as a positive force in the world.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Raleigh, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been enthusiastic about technology, but hope to actually begin contributing to the field, rather
        than only benefiting from it. Being a teacher is its own sort of admirable job, but I believe my strengths would be better utilized in a 
        tech position, especially if my company is effecting real positive change in society.
